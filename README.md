# Clash-Detection-Matrix-Automation
Automating Clash Detection through a workflow from Revit, Dynamo and ending in Navisworks using Python scripting as BIG Data Analysis tool

##What can do with this workflow?
1. If you would like to have information of all your Revit modelled **Elements** and **Categories** for both linked and active/open revit models, exported to an **Excel spreadsheet** in just one click, then the first part of this workflow would be just great.
2. If your company or business works with an Excel Clash Matrix template as guide for carrying out Clash detections in Navisworks, then this workflow can help you auhtomate the creation of your Clash Matrix template based on the project's disciplines, model categories and element types. This can be done in just one click
3. If you need an update of newly modelled elements in your project (for all disciplines, linked and active models) with an Excel spreadsheet capturing the changes in realtime. Then you'll benefit a lot from this.
4. If you don't want to go through the boredom involved in manually creating search sets and populating clash tolerances in Navisworks by automating the whole process, then follow through
